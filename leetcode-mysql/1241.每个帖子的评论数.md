left join + sum(布尔表达式) 

```sql
with t1 as (
    select distinct sub_id, parent_id from Submissions 
    where parent_id is null 
), t2 as (
    select distinct sub_id, parent_id from Submissions
    where parent_id is not null 
)

select 
    t1.sub_id as post_id, 
    sum(t2.parent_id is not null) as number_of_comments
from t1 
left join t2 on t2.parent_id = t1.sub_id 
group by t1.sub_id 
order by t1.sub_id
```
