# 思路


## 我的思路：子查询 + group by + count() + order by 取第一个即可
```sql
select customer_number 
from (
    select customer_number, count(*) as cnt 
    from Orders group by customer_number 
    order by cnt desc 
    limit 1
) t;
```

## 官方题解
在order by后直接使用count()
```sql
SELECT
    customer_number
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
