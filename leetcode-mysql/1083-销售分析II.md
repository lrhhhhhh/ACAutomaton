# 题意
求买了S8但没买IPhone的人

group by + having + count() + if()


推荐解法：
```sql
SELECT S.buyer_id
FROM Sales S 
JOIN Product P ON S.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY S.buyer_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'S8',TRUE, NULL)) >= 1 AND 
    COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'iPhone',TRUE, NULL)) = 0
```



解法1：
```sql
with t as (
    select buyer_id, p.product_name from Sales s
    inner join Product p on p.product_id = s.product_id 
    where p.product_name = 'S8' or p.product_name = 'iPhone'
)

select distinct(t1.buyer_id) from t t1 
where t1.buyer_id not in (
    select t2.buyer_id from t t2 where t2.product_name = 'iPhone'
) and t1.product_name = 'S8'
```

解法2：
```sql
with t1 as (
    select buyer_id from Sales s
    inner join Product p on p.product_id = s.product_id 
    where p.product_name = 'S8' 
), t2 as (
    select buyer_id from Sales s
    inner join Product p on p.product_id = s.product_id 
    where p.product_name = 'iPhone'
)

select distinct(t1.buyer_id) from t1
where t1.buyer_id not in (select * from t2);
